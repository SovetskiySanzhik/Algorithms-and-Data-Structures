## Getting Started

Here is my implementation of some algorithms and data structures in Java. I wrote the code in the program Vscode.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `algorithms`: the folder for storing the algorithms of such different sorting
- `data_structures`: A folder for storing classes that implement different data structures, e.g. ArrayList
- `tests`: folder for checking the work of the data structures
